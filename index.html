            <p>Nice to meet you! I'm a professional passionate about continuous learning and challenges. My journey
                began with a degree in Commercial Management from Fatec Ipiranga/SP, followed by eight years of
                experience in a multinational company, where I developed valuable skills. In 2019, I decided to explore
                the world of Full Stack programming, participating in a course that provided me with incredible
                experiences and the opportunity to work on collaborative projects. In recent years, I contributed to the
                growth of an event connectivity startup, where I was able to apply my knowledge and learn even more.
                Recently, I earned my first certification in Cloud fundamentals, an important step in my quest for
                constant improvement. And this year, I'm excited to earn new certifications and continue growing in the
                technology field.</p>
